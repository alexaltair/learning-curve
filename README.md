## Learning Curve Labs
###### What is it?

Learning Curve Labs is a place for programmers to pose questions and get answers from their peers. Sound familiar? Of course it does, however, at Learning Curve we allow users to pose and answer questions via short video's they upload. 

###### Why is it useful?

How often are you ripping though some code only to get stuck on something, and then lost in documentation that you just don't quite get or is sufficiently confusing enough to derail your momentum? With this app you will be able to pose that question and get a short answer that literally shows you how to fix your code, not tell you. 

###### How?

Using a very intuitive UI the user will name their video and describe it, and then choose the video file they wish to upload. Answers and questions will be user moderated via up/down votes. The only off topic content that will be allowed is cat videos, because we all need a break here and there.

###### Challenges?

Making an efficient search that returns relevant questions/answers will be interesting. Also, we will need to seed a bunch of content in order to show this app in action. 

###### Conclusion

Let's continue the tradition of helping each other with this new and exciting educational tool!
